Initial Testing of Markdown
================

We can also produce numbered lists

1.  item 1
2.  item 2
3.  item 3

This is an example of using **R Markdown**.

The real strength, of course, is to be able to include code as well.

code bloksc involve backticks and options.

``` r
x <- 5
y <- 10
x + y
```

    ## [1] 15

Furthermore, we can also do short things inline, e.g.Â x is 5.

In addition to code, Markdown makes web communication reasonable.

For example, the github site for this project is
<https://github.com/kabagg/fda_2018_live>

If I want to use a short name for the web page, I can do that
[too](https://github.com/kabagg/fda_2018_live)

We also want

# Sections of Text

## Subsections of Text

### Subsubsections of Text

how about lists?

  - item 1
  - item 2
  - item 33
